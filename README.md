# Diabetes Prediction using a Decision Tree Algorithm

This project uses a decision tree algorithm to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not. This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective is to predict based on diagnostic measurements whether a patient has diabetes.

The project is implemented in Python using the Pandas & Scikit-learn libraries. The steps involved are:

1. Importing the necessary libraries
2. Loading the dataset
3. Splitting the dataset into training and test sets
4. Building the decision tree model
5. Evaluating the model performance
6. Visualizing the decision tree

The project also includes a Jupyter notebook that walks through the implementation in more detail.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have Python and the Scikit-learn library installed. Once you have these installed, you can clone the GitHub repository and open the Jupyter notebook.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Diabetes Dataset. This dataset contains observations of 9 features, including:

* Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
* Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
* BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
* SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
* Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
* BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
* DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
* Age: Age (years)
* Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)

## Model

The decision tree model is built using the Scikit-learn `DecisionTreeClassifier` class. The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set. The accuracy of the model is 71.43%.

## Visualization

The decision tree can be visualized using the Scikit-learn `export_graphviz` function. The visualization can be saved as a PNG image or a PDF file.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to use a decision tree algorithm to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not. The project is implemented in Python using the Scikit-learn library. The project also includes a Jupyter notebook that walks through the implementation in more detail.
